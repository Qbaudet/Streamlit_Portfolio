    I am currently pursuing a master's degree at <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>EFREI Paris</span>, specializing in the <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>Data & AI major</span>.  
    My passion for data started during my first internship at **Ubisoft**, where I was introduced to the role of a Data Scientist. Since then, I have been driven to apply my growing skills and knowledge to this field.
    
    Data science indeed combines two of my greatest childhood interests:
    - <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>Investigation</span>: The process of gathering evidence, uncovering patterns in data, and making critical decisions based on these insights. As a fan of scientific police TV shows, I was always drawn to investigations and I'm glad that working with data allows me to fulfill this need in a different way.
    - <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>Pedagogy</span>: The ability to clearly present findings to non-technical teams, ensuring that all necessary information is communicated effectively. This aspect resonates with my childhood dream of becoming a teacher and my love for helping friends overcome difficulties in school.
    
    I find these two parallels between my childhood aspirations and the world of data absolutely fascinating, and it only strengthens my conviction that I am truly meant for this field.
