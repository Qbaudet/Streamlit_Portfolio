    The dataset I‚Äôve chosen is the <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>"Indicateurs de valeur ajout√©e des lyc√©es d'enseignement g√©n√©ral et technologique"</span> dataset, which provides a precise look at how well high schools in France help their students succeed.  
    I picked this dataset because it goes beyond just showing baccalaureate pass rates since it actually highlights the impact each school has on student outcomes, by using an <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>added value metric</span>. It is calculated by finding the expected results of the school considering things like <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>student demographics</span> and <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>academic backgrounds</span>, and then compares it to the actual results to give a score.  
    In my opinion, it offers a more meaningful view of school performance because it takes into consideration the entire context instead of just looking at the numbers.
    
    It is thus perfect for exploring the way in which different french high schools contribute to the success of their students, with data ranging from 2013 to 2023.

    The dataset was taken from the <span style='color:#38b3fc; font-weight:bold;'>data.gouv</span> french website which is trustworthy, here is the link if you want to check it out! [Dataset](https://data.education.gouv.fr/explore/dataset/fr-en-indicateurs-de-resultat-des-lycees-gt_v2/information/?disjunctive.uai&disjunctive.secteur&disjunctive.libelle_commune&disjunctive.libelle_departement&disjunctive.libelle_academie&disjunctive.libelle_region&sort=num_ligne).

            From what we've seen during this data analysis, the <span style='color:#38b3fc;'>added value</span> is a difficult metric to analyse patterns from. Since it is calculated individualy based on the specific factors of each highschools, we cannot truly understand the meaning behind each of its values.
            However, we were able to pick up on a few overall trends during this exploration. 
            Namely, the <span style='color:#38b3fc;'>Covid-19</span> had a huge impact on the success rates of the baccalaureate exams, getting record scores. The situation is only progressively getting back to normal rates, but we can still see that overall the success rates and even the honours are higher than before.
               
            This can either indicate that the <span style='color:#38b3fc;'>exams got easier</span> with the introduction of continuous marking, but could also tell that <span style='color:#38b3fc;'>the students are getting better</span>.
